Singleton class
===============
Singleton class is a class which can have only one object at a time, and after that if we try to create another object then in that case the new reference variable also points to the previously created object.

Rules to create Singleton class : 

1. Make constructor private
2. Make a static method which returns object of that singleton class and whose return type is of that specific Singleton class
